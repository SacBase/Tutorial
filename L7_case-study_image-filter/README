This directory contains:
 - example implementation of Sobel and Gauss image filters
 - sample image data as input in testimages.tar.bz2:
     - hall.fibre (large, 4288x2848 pixels)
     - saclogo.fibre (small, 130x70 pixels)
     - saclogo.dat (same as above but in simple matrix format)


To compile this program, run 

  sac2c -D<filter> image_filter.sac -o image_filter

where <filter> is one of the following: SOBEL, GAUSS, GAUSS25. If no -D
is given a Sobel filter will be used.

The program reads an image in fibre format from stdin and writes
the resulting image to stdout in simple matrix format. This
format may be conveniently plotted using gnuplot. For example,
after running the program:

  ./image_filter < saclogo.fibre > saclogo-edges.dat

display the image data using gnuplot:

  gnuplot> plot "saclogo.dat" matrix with image
  gnuplot> plot "saclogo-edges.dat" matrix with image
