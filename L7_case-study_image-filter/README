This directory contains:
 - example implementation of Sobel and Gauss image filters
 - sample image data as input in testimages.tar.bz2:
     - hall.fibre (large, 4288x2848 pixels)
     - saclogo.fibre (small, 130x70 pixels)
     - saclogo.dat (same as above but in simple matrix format)


To compile this program, run 

  sac2c -D<filter> -D<clock> -D<format> image_filter.sac -o image_filter


See below for description of available options:

<filter>: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <filter> may be one of the following: SOBEL, GAUSS, GAUSS25. 

  If no filter is given a Sobel filter will be used.
  
<clock>:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <clock> may be one of the following: RTCLOCK, SIMPLECLOCK

  If no clock is specified, RTCLOCK will be used.

  RTCLOCK may not be available on all systems. If you are running a
  system where this is the case and this program fails to compile,
  use -DSIMPLECLOCK. Measurement accuracy will be limited to whole
  seconds.

<format>:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <format> may be one of the following: PNG, RAWIMAGE

  If no format is given, PNG will be used.

  PNG:
  The program reads an image in fibre format from stdin and writes
  a PNG file named "result.png" into the current working directory.
  
  
  RAWIMAGE:
  The program reads an image in fibre format from stdin and writes
  the resulting image to stdout in simple matrix format. This
  format may be conveniently plotted using gnuplot. For example,
  after running the program:
  
    ./image_filter < saclogo.fibre > saclogo-edges.dat
  
  display the image data using gnuplot:
  
    gnuplot> plot "saclogo.dat" matrix with image
    gnuplot> plot "saclogo-edges.dat" matrix with image
